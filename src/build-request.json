      "text": "Fix the bouquet illustration in the Virtual Rose Gift section so it reliably loads and displays in production deployments (including when the app is hosted under a non-root base path). Update the image `src` construction to use the app base URL (instead of a hard-coded leading `/` path), and add a graceful fallback if the image fails to load.",

        "The bouquet image displays in the Virtual Rose Gift section on both mobile and desktop in a production build.",
        "The bouquet image URL is constructed in a way that works when the site is served from a subpath (i.e., does not rely on an absolute `/assets/...` path).",
        "If the bouquet image cannot be loaded (e.g., missing asset), the UI shows a non-blocking fallback (e.g., styled placeholder container and/or short text) and does not break layout.",
